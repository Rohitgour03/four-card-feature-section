## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I challenge myself to use the css grid to build this project component, because I learned this recently but wanna practice that so.

### Continued development

I found the CSS grid amazing and very helpful in multi-column layout. So I think i am using the same in every layout projects.

### Useful resources

- [ Centering with CSS grid ](https://coryrylan.com/blog/how-to-center-in-css-with-css-grid) - This helped me better understand the CSS grid. I really liked this layout method and will use it going forward.
- [ A complete guide to the CSS grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
